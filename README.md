<h1 align="">Hi, it's Rhea! âœ¨</h1>
<p>
Hello! I'm a professional full stack web developer with experience working with various technologies such as React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Java Spring, Typescript and more. My primary strength is flexibility: I can adapt and learn new technologies on the fly very quickly. I also have some DevSecOps experience working with Jenkins pipelines and Docker.
