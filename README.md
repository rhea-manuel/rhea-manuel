Hello! I'm a full stack web developer in training with a background in UI/UX design. I've worked on several
video game titles as a UI/UX designer and programmer and am currently studying web development. I'm
a huge believer in efficient, clean design in both user interface design and programming. I work very hard
to ensure my designs and code don't just work: they're also as efficient, concise, and readable as
possible.
